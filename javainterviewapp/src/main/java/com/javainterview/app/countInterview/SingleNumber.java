/**
 * Leetcode: 136
 * Company: Palantir, Airbnb
 * Tags: Hash Table, Bit Manipulation
 * 
 * Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except one.
 * Find the integer.
 *
 * Solution: O(n)
 *
 * XOR is commutative, so changing the order does not have an effect.
 *
 * N XOR N = 0
 * A XOR 0 = A
 *
 * If we XOR all the numbers together, eventually we will be left with the
 * excluded number.

     * Solution:
     * We will use the same XOR val from before.
     * This gets us the XOR of both numbers.
     * Since we know that having a 1 is where the two numbers diff.
     *
     * Then we loop through the numbers again
     * We compare the bit with the numbers.
     * We treat the numbers into 2 groups.
     * 1st group has bits that match the 1st number.
     * 2nd group has bits that match the 2nd number.
     * We can find this by using a 1 bit in the first diff.
