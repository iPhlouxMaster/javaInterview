/**
 * LeetCode: 338
 * Tags: Dynamic programming, bit manipulation
 * 
 * Created on 3/20/2016.
 *
 * Problem:
 * Given a non negative integer.
 * For every integer from 0 to num.
 * Find the numbers of 1s and return them in an array.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Take the current rightmost digit for the bits.
 * Then we just need to add the count for the digits to the left.
 * To get all the digits to the left, we shift to the right.
 *
 * Example:
 * 0 -> 0
 * 01 -> Take 1, and then shift to get 0, and count[0] = 0
 * We add 1 with 0.
 * 10 -> Take 0, and then shift to get 1, and we already have count[1]
 * 11 -> Take 1, and shift to get 1, and we already have count for 1
 * 101 -> Take 1, and shift to get 10, and we already have count[10]
