/**
 * Created on 9/27/2015.
 *
 * Find if there is a mountain where when it rains, water can flow into both
 * Pacific and Atlantic ocean.
 * Water flows from higher to equal or lower elevation.
 * The mountain will comprise of points that are accessible from both oceans.
 *
 * Pacific Ocean: left and top side of matrix
 * Atlantic Ocean: right and bottom side of matrix
 *
 * Given a n*n matrix, number in each node means elevation.
 *
 * How can we get all nodes that water can flow to both oceans?
 * The idea is to start from known points such as the pacific and atlantic sides.
 * Then for each point, search for a path upwards to higher elevation.
 *
 * The points that can accessed by both oceans will be this mountain.
