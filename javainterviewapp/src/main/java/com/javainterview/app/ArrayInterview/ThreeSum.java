/**
 * Created on 4/3/2016.
 *
 * Given an array of integers.
 * Find elements such that a + b + c = 0
 * Find unique triplets that equals the target sum
 *
 * This problem is for unique numbers.
 *
 * Solution:
 * Sort the numbers so we can compare the size of the running sum
 *
 * We loop through the array and choose the first number.
 * This loop stops at length minus 2.
 *
 * If we are at the first number or the first number is not a duplicate then choose it.
 * The second number is 1 after the first number.
 * The third number is the end of the array.
 *
 * We then calculate a running sum.
 * Loop through the array while the second number is less than the third number.
 *   Compare the running sum by adding the second and third numbers.
 *   If they match our targetsum, then add them into our result list.
 *     increment the second number based on duplicates
 *     decrement the third number based on duplicates
 *   If they do not match, then compare with our target sum
 *     If the running sum is too small, then move the second number to the next.
 *     If the running sum is too large, then move the third number to the previous.
 *
 * Return the result list
 *
 * Runtime: O(N^2)
 *   The first loop is for choose n numbers for the first number.
 *   The second loop is choosing the second and third numbers.
