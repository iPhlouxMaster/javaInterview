 * Tags: Design
 * 
 * Implement an iterator to flatten a 2d vector
 * 
 * Given 2d vector =
 * [
 *  [1,2],
 *  [3],
 *  [4,5,6]
 * ]
 * By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
 * the order of elements returned by next should be: 
 * [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * 
 * Hints
 * How many variables do you need to keep track?
 * 
 * Two variables is all you need. Try with x and y.
 * 
 * Beware of empty rows. It could be the first few rows.
 * 
 * To write correct code, think about the invariant to maintain. What is it?
 * 
 * The invariant is x and y must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. 
 *      Should you maintain your invariant ahead of time or right when you need it?
 * 
 * Not sure? Think about how you would implement hasNext(). Which is more complex?
 * 
 * Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method.
 *
